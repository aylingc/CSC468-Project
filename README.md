Original Description of Project:
This is an informative media description and review service that is hosted by our own web server. Users of the service are able to create their own personal account with log-in service using the LDAP protocol. The service will allow different users to locate a specific media that they would like to leave a review about. Other users will then be able to look up said media on their own account and be able to view the directory of reviews made over time. The database is maintained by use of MySQL.
